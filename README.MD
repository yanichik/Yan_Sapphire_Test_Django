# Sapphire Studios - Live Code Test

Introduction
================
Congratulations on making it this far! We are excited to see what you can do with the following test. We have provided you with a simple web application that allows you to show us your skills with fullstack development. Below we will outline the tasks we would like you to complete.

Tasks
================

## Task 1 - If no submissions exist, display a message to the user
If no submissions exist, display a message to the user that says "No submissions yet" instead of the "Top Submissions" section.

## Task 2: Complete the upload flow
The upload flow is currently incomplete. We would like you to complete the flow so that the user can:
1. Make sure the user is logged in before allowing them to submit a new upload.
   * If the user is not logged in show a login button that will redirect them to the login.
   * If the user is logged in show the upload now button already provided.
2. Upload a file and see the preview before submitting the form
3. Submit the form
    * The submission model has a rating field, set this to a random value between 1 and 100.

## Task 3: Display the top 10 submissions
Currently, the home page displays the top 5 submissions. We would like you to change this so that the top 10 submissions are displayed based on the rating field.

Bonus Tasks
================
We have added bonus tasks that we would like to see you complete if you have time remaining after completing the above tasks. Not completing these tasks will not affect your application. These tasks are optional and are not required to be completed.

## Bonus Task: Clean up the UI
We would like you to clean up the UI of the application. Feel free to use any CSS framework you would like. We would like you to make the application look as good as possible. You are at liberty to change any part of the application you would like.

## Bonus Task 2 - Create a login/signup flow
We would like you to create a login/signup flow for the application. The user should be able to login and signup using their username. This can be a dedicated page or modal. The UI for this is dependent on your skills and creativity. Use any libraries you want to make this process easier.

_Note: The application is using the default Django user model so this should make the backend work easier on this._
